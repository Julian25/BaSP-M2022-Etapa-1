# Trackgenix landing page

This project consists of the landing page of Trackgenix web system, which has been developed with human resources management purpose.


# Weekly progress:

## Week 01:

Working as a team, the complete prototype of the Trackgenix web system was generated using Figma

## Week 02

The HTML code of the landing page of this web system has been written in order to obtain the structure of the prototype previously designed in Figma. This code has been developed paying special attention to the correct semantic use of html tags.

## Week 03

The style sheet of this project has been written with the purpose of giving the HTML file the necessary styles to obtain an equal layout (of pixel perfect quality) to the prototype previously developed in figma. This version is not responsive.

## Week 04

Using Flexbox, a version was generated that is completely responsive and can be viewed on mobile devices (smart phone and tablet) as well as on a computer.

## Week 05
During the fifth week, Javascript exercises with the purpose of acquiring basic concepts of this programming language were solved.
